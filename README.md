Ruby IRC bot & web interface
===

Using the 'cinch' and 'data_mapper' gems, I made an IRC bot that stores info in a database in response to certain commands. 


View logbot.ngrok.com to see the commands accepted by the IRC bot. That site is a Sinatra app that is configured to share a database with the IRC bot. You can view all the data saved by the bot and sort entries by user and topic. 


The bot currently resides in ##codeunion and #appacad-sf-aug4-2014 on Freenode (go to kiwiirc.com to use IRC in your browser)
